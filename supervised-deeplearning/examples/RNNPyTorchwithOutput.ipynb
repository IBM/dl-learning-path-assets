    "*<strong>Recurrent neural networks</strong>*, or RNNs, are widely used in a variety of mediums. RNNs leverage sequential data to make predictions. **Sequential memory** makes it easier for the neural network to recognize patterns and replicate the input. In order to achieve learning through sequential memory, a **feedforward neural network** with looping mechanisms is implemented. \n",
    "\n",
    "As the image below outlines, there are *three* layers: **input, hidden and output**. There are loops that pass previous information forward, allowing the model to *sequentially* store and learn the data. The complexity of a hidden state is based on how much “historic” information is being stored, it is a representation of all previous steps. When training a model, once there is a prediction from a given output, a **loss function** is used to determine the error between the predicted output and real output. The model is trained through back propagation. The weight of each node in the neural network is adjusted with their corresponding gradient that is calculated during **back propagation**. \n",

    "[\"Learning to store information over extended time intervals by recurrent backpropagation takes a very long time, mostly because of insufficient, decaying error backflow\".*](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6795963) \n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this issue a type of RNN called **long short term memory** is used. [**LSTMs**](https://developer.ibm.com/tutorials/iot-deep-learning-anomaly-detection-1/) are able to keep track of long term dependencies by using gradients to modify the model, rather than backpropogations. These attributes are especially advantageous when examining **time series data**. The more historical data there is, the better the model can train, producing the most accurate outputs. \n",
    "\n",
    "An LSTM has an internal state variable that is modified based on weights and biases through operation gates. Traditionally, an LSTM is comprised of three operation gates: the forget gate, input gate, and output gate. The architecture of long short term memory is dependent on $tanh$ and $sigmoid$ functions implemented in the network. The $tahn$ function ensures that the values in the network remain between -1 and 1 while the $sigmoid$ function regulates if data should be remembered or forgotten. Furthermore, \n",

    "* $b_o$ = connection bias at output gate \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Each gate modifies the input a different way. The forget gate determines what data is relevant to keep and what information can be \"forgotten\". The input gate analyzes what information needs to be added to the current step, and the output gate finalizes the proceeding hidden state. Each of these gates allows for sequential data to be efficiently stored and analyzed, allowing for an accurate predictive model to be developed. \n",

    "Prior to training a model, it is important to understand the type of data you are working with. There are many different types of data, this notebook incorporates time series data. In essence, time series data is a collection of chronologically collected observations made over a period of time- sometimes during specific intervals. Time series data can be grouped as either *<strong>metrics</strong>* or *<strong>events</strong>*. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Metrics**: measurements taken at regular intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Events**: measurements taken at irregular intervals. \n",
    "\n",
    "Distinguishing if the data is comprised of metrics or events is critical. Events are not condusive for creating predictive models. The irregular intervals between each data point prevents sequential logic from creating patterns on past behavior. In contrast, the characteristic regularity between each metric allows machine learing models to learn from previous data and construct possible outcomes for the future. Creating an RNN using time series data, specifically metrics, is a great way to take advantage of the sequential learning pattern they leverage. \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, time series data can also be categorized as *<strong>linear</strong>* or *<strong>non-linear</strong>*. Based on the mathematical relationship created by the model, the data is classified as one or the other.\n",
