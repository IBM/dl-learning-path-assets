E. Hinton and R. R. Salakhutdinov</b>, showed better results than years of refining other types of network, and was a breakthrough in the field of Neural Networks, a field that was \"stagnant\" for 10 years.\n","\n","Now, autoencoders, based on Restricted Boltzmann Machines, are employed in some of the largest deep learning applications.

This image is 256x256 pixels, which corresponds to an input vector of 65536 dimensions! Conventional cell phones can produce images in the  4000 x 3000 pixels range, which gives us 12 million dimensions to analyze.\n","\n","This is particularly problematic, since the difficulty of a machine learning problem is vastly increased as more dimensions are involved. According to a 1982 study by C.J. Stone *[(link)](\"http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jizhu/jizhu/wuke/Stone-AoS82.pdf\")*, the time to fit a model, is optimal if:\n","\n","$ m^{-p/(2p+d)} $\n","\n","Where:\n","* m: Number of data points\n","* d: Dimensionality of the data\n","* p: Number of Parameters in the model\n","\n","As you can see, it increases exponentially!\n","\n","Returning to our example, we don't need to use all of the 65,536 dimensions to classify an emotion.\n","A human identifies emotions according to specific facial expressions, and some **key features**, like the shape of the mouth and eyebrows.\n","\n","<center><img src=\"../images/examplePFPMarked.png\" height=\"256\" width=\"256\"></center>\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["---\n","## Autoencoder Structure\n","---\n","<center><img src=\"../images/encoderDecoder.png\" style=\"width: 400px;\"></center>\n","\n","\n","An autoencoder can be divided in two parts, the **encoder** and the **decoder**.\n","\n","The *encoder* needs to compress the representation of an input. In this case, we are going to reduce the dimensions of the image of the example face from 2000 dimensions to only 30 dimensions.  We will acomplish this by running the data through the layers of our encoder.\n","\n","The *decoder* works like encoder network in reverse. It works to recreate the input as closely as possible.
